# php-framework-comparison

Welcome.
I've worked with Yii(1+2) framework for 10+ years.
Laravel only <1 year.
My personal opinion might be slightly biased. I will keep updating this.

These are major differences I've found out. I might be wrong here. Please create github issue if you don't agree with me.
